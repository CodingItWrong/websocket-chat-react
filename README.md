# websocket-echo-react

A simple WebSocket client using React and Create React App.

Because some abstractions over WebSocket only work in the browser, compatibility with this tool doesn't confirm that a given WebSocket backend is standards-compliant. Consider testing in [websocket-echo-expo](https://github.com/CodingItWrong/websocket-echo-expo) as well.

## Requirements

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- A [websocket-echo backend](https://github.com/CodingItWrong?tab=repositories&q=websocket-echo&type=&language=&sort=)

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3001`
